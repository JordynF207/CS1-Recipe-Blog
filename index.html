     <p>Red Velvet is a rich cake with lots of flavor, it is an amazing cake for you to share with your friends!</p>
     <h3>Ingredents<h3>
     <ul>
      <li>3 cups of cake flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoon pure vanilla extractr</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar</li>
      <li>4 large eggs, room temperature and separated</li>
      <li>liquid or gel red food coloring</li>
      <li> 1 cup of buttermilk, at room temperature</li>
      <li>16 ounces of full-fat brick cream cheese, softened to room temperature</li>
      <li>3/4 cup of unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
      <li>5 cups of confectioners‚Äô sugar</li>
      <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>pinch of salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350¬∞F. Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. If it‚Äôs helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post</li>.
      <li> Whisk the flour, baking soda, cocoa powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the oil, egg yolks, vanilla extract, and vinegar and beat on high for 2 minutes. (Set the egg whites aside.) Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed.</li>
      <li>With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in 2-3 additions alternating with the buttermilk. Beat in your desired amount of food coloring just until combined. I use 1-2 teaspoons gel food coloring. Vigorously whisk or beat the 4 egg whites on high speed until fluffy peaks form as pictured above, about 3 minutes. Gently fold into cake batter. The batter will be silky and slightly thick.</li>
      <li>Divide batter between cake pans. Bake for 30-32 minutes or until the tops of the cakes spring back when gently touched and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If the cakes need a little longer as determined by wet crumbs on the toothpick, bake for longer. However, careful not to overbake as the cakes may dry out. Remove cakes from the oven and cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.</li>
      <li>Make the frosting: In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners‚Äô sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 3 minutes until completely combined and creamy. Add more confectioners‚Äô sugar if frosting is too thin or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. Frosting should be soft, but not runny.</li>
      <li>Assemble and frost: Using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard or crumble over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides</li>
      <li>Refrigerate cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing. This helps the cake hold its shape when cutting.</li>

    <h3>üéäFunfetti CakeüéÇ</h3>
    <img src="https://everythingjustbaked.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_9105-scaled.jpg" width="40%">
    <p>This colorful cake is so delicious, it has so many flavors. It is perfect for a party!</p>
    <ul>
    <li>3 and 3/4 cups (443g) cake flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 and 1/4 cups (282g) unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 and 1/2 cups buttermilk, at room temperature</li>
    <li>3/4 cup rainbow sprinkles</li>
    <li>1 and 1/2 cups unsalted butter</li>
    <li>5 and 1/2 cups confectioners‚Äô sugar</li>
    <li>1/3 cup heavy cream, at room temperature</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons pure vanilla extract </li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350¬∞F (177¬∞C). Grease three 8-inch or 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans.</li>
      <li>Make the cake: Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed for 5 full minutes until completely creamed together and fluffy. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed. Add the oil and beat for 1 minute until combined. Add the eggs, egg whites, and vanilla extract and beat on medium-high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed.</li>
      <li>Add dry ingredients and buttermilk in three additions, mixing after each addition just until incorporated. Do not over-mix this batter. The batter will be velvety and thick. Gently fold in the sprinkles. Pour and spread the batter evenly into each cake pan.</li>
      <li>Bake for around 25‚Äì26 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. (8-inch cakes may take about 27‚Äì28 minutes.) Tent the cakes with foil after about 15 minutes to prevent the sides and top from over-browning. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it‚Äôs done</li>
      <li>Allow cakes to cool in the pans set on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Run a knife around the edges and then remove cakes from pans. Place cakes directly on wire racks to cool completely. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.</li>
      <li>Make the frosting: In a large bowl using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners‚Äô sugar, cream, vanilla extract, and salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds and then switch to high speed and beat for 2 minutes. Add more confectioners‚Äô sugar if frosting seems too thin; more cream if frosting is too thick; or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet.</li>
      <li>Assemble cake + apply crumb coat: First, using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!). Place one cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable, or serving plate. Using a flat icing spatula or small offset spatula, evenly cover the top with about 1 cup (about 250g) of frosting. Repeat with second cake layer, 1 more cup of frosting, and then the top cake layer. Spread a thin layer of frosting on the top and around the sides as a crumb coat. Run a bench scraper around the cake to smooth out crumb coat. Chill uncovered in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to 3 hours to set the crumb coat.</li>
      <li>Spread the remaining frosting all over the top and sides. Garnish with extra sprinkles, if desired.</li>
