      <li>Combine dry ingrients: sift flower, cocoa, baking powder and baking soda all into a large bowl</li>
      <li>Blend in sugar. Add both sugars and salt and whisk to blend well, pressing out any lumps of brown sugar.</li>
      <li>Combine wet ingredients. Combine eggs, oil, sour cream and vanilla in a medium bowl and whisk to blend well, then add to the dry ingredients. In a pinch you can also add these ingredients directly to the bowl with the dry ingredients.</li>
      <li>Mix wet and dry ingredients. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix with a whisk or an electric hand mixer on medium-low until blended. It will be thick and somewhat dry.</li>
      <li>Mix in hot coffee. Add the hot coffee gradually in two stages to minimize clumps forming and beat until evenly combined and the batter smooth.</li>
      <li>Bake. Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake for 30-33 minutes until cakes spring back when pressed gently and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer pans to a wire rack and let cool for 15 minutes before inverting onto the rack to cool completely.</li>
