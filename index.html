     <h2>Red Velvet CakeüéÇ</h2>
     <p>Red Velvet is a rich cake with lots of flavor, it is an amazing cake for you to share with your friends!</p>
     <h3>Ingredents<h3>
     <ul>
      <li>3 cups of cake flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoon pure vanilla extractr</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar</li>
      <li>4 large eggs, room temperature and separated</li>
      <li>liquid or gel red food coloring</li>
      <li> 1 cup of buttermilk, at room temperature</li>
      <li>16 ounces of full-fat brick cream cheese, softened to room temperature</li>
      <li>3/4 cup of unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
      <li>5 cups of confectioners‚Äô sugar</li>
      <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>pinch of salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350¬∞F. Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. If it‚Äôs helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post</li>.
      <li> Whisk the flour, baking soda, cocoa powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the oil, egg yolks, vanilla extract, and vinegar and beat on high for 2 minutes. (Set the egg whites aside.) Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed.</li>
      <li>With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in 2-3 additions alternating with the buttermilk. Beat in your desired amount of food coloring just until combined. I use 1-2 teaspoons gel food coloring. Vigorously whisk or beat the 4 egg whites on high speed until fluffy peaks form as pictured above, about 3 minutes. Gently fold into cake batter. The batter will be silky and slightly thick.</li>
      <li>Divide batter between cake pans. Bake for 30-32 minutes or until the tops of the cakes spring back when gently touched and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If the cakes need a little longer as determined by wet crumbs on the toothpick, bake for longer. However, careful not to overbake as the cakes may dry out. Remove cakes from the oven and cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.</li>
      <li>Make the frosting: In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners‚Äô sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 3 minutes until completely combined and creamy. Add more confectioners‚Äô sugar if frosting is too thin or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. Frosting should be soft, but not runny.</li>
      <li>Assemble and frost: Using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard or crumble over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides</li>
      <li>Refrigerate cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing. This helps the cake hold its shape when cutting.</li>
